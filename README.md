# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction
We apply Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to stock price prediction  for forecasting accuracy in the years of volatile financial  markets. Using historical data of stock prices we created a predictive model that accurately captures low dimensional temporal  dependencies in stock price movements. Our approach consists of two steps: data preprocessing to refine features and training of LSTM for different time intervals. It makes use of KPIs such as MAE or RMSE to assess performance. We show that LSTM networks substantially improve over all baseline forecasting techniques. This study serves to build on the current literature regarding machine learning  approaches to finance and support the utilization of deep  learning methodologies to some non-linear.
